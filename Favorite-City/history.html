                    Raleigh is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest populated city in North Carolina, next to Charlotte, which is the 
                    largest populated in the state. In fact, according to <i>Data Commons</i>
                    <a href="https://datacommons.org/place/geoId/3755000?utm_medium=explore&mprop=count&popt=Person&hl=en#:~:text=Population%3A%20469%2C124%20(2021" target="_blank">(datacommons.org),</a>
                    Raleigh's population in 2021 was an astounding 469,124 people.<br><br>
                    Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh and it was the very same Sir Walter Raleigh that established the Roanoke Colony (also known as the Lost Colony).
                    After Queen Elizabeth died circa 1603, Sir Raleigh was imprisioned for his involvement in the Main Plot against King James I.<br><br>
                    In 1616, he was released to fulfill a journey in find El Dorado. During this mission, his men plundered a Spanish outpost which in turn, violated Sir Raleigh's pardon and the peace treaty 
                    that was held with Spain.<br><br>
                    In order to make peace with Spain once again, once Raleigh returned to England, he was subsequently arrested and put to death in 1618.

                    Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina#Notable_people:~:text=Raleigh%20is%20an%20early%20example%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20a%20planned%20city" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
                    A planned city is any city, town, community, etc. that is/was planned from scratch before 
                    any construction has begun; these settlements are usually built on previously undeveloped land.<br><br>
                    After the American Revolutionary War, Raleigh was chosen to be the state captial (which occurred in 1788). It became the official captial in 1792.<br><br>
                    Raleigh is also called the "City of Oaks" because it has so many oak trees, especially in the heart of the city.

                    The flag of Raleigh is the official municipal flag of Raleigh, North Carolina (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Raleigh,_North_Carolina#:~:text=The%20flag%20of%20Raleigh%20is%20the%20official%20municipal%20flag%20of%20Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina." target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).<br><br>
                    Raleigh's flag may be the only American city flag to have different designs on both sides of the flag. Richmond, Virginia had a two-sided design before its flag 
                    change in 1993.<br><br>
                    On the front side of Raleigh's flag, the red-white-red pattern is an ode to Sir Walter Raleigh as those were the colors of his arms. The oak tree in the middle is 
                    a reference to Raleigh's nickname, "City of Oaks". The green wreath surrounding the whole of the rest of the flag is another reference to the city's abundance of oak 
                    trees.<br><br>
                    The back side of Raleigh's flag showcases Sir Raleigh's coat of arms. Above this symbol stands a deer which is a reference to the name "Raleigh" because the Old English 
                    meaning of Raleigh is "meadow of the deer". The words below the coat of arms reads "Amore et Virtute" (Sir Raleigh's motto), translated into English being: "By Love and Valor".
