                        Raleigh has its own culture and traditions that are upheld every year.
                        For example, for the New Year's holiday, Raleigh drops the "Acorn". This is 
                        in reference to its many oak trees. There are certain foods that are very popular in 
                        the city and there are even events held in place to showcase the food made in Raleigh. 
                        On this page, we'll be exploring the culture and (more deliciously) the taste of Raleigh.

                        Food festivals are top tier in Raleigh. If you visit Raleigh and 
                        don't participate in a food festival, did you really go to Raleigh?<br>
                        Short answer: No.

                            Food festivals are the heart of Raleigh. Food is everything and everything is food. Simple enough.<br> 
                            Raleigh recently had it's sixth International Food Festival where it featured foods from all over the world.<br> 
                            If global foods doesn't have your mouth watering yet, Raleigh's local food festivals and beer festivals might 
                            get your taste buds running.<br>
                            By the way, you should probably go catch those, you'll need them for Raleigh.

                            So many good foods are served in Raleigh and since it's made in the South, it's even tastier. Some yummy delights include:<br>
                            <li>Barbeque (I literally grew up on this)</li>
                            <li>Fried Chicken</li>
                            <li>Grits</li>
                            <li>Biscuits</li>
                            <li>Hushpuppies (If they're not made in the South, they're not real hushpuppies. Argue with the wall. I don't make the rules.)</li>
                            <li>Country Ham</li>
                            <li>Collard Greens</li>
                            <li>Mac and Cheese</li>
                            <li>Fried Green Tomatoes (The real showstopper here)</li>
                            <li>Sweet Potato Pie (Heaven in your mouth)</li><br>
                            <p>
                                Bonus fact: Krispy Kreme Donuts, yes the super yum donut franchise was established in Winston Salem, literally a few hours 
                                away from Raleigh in 1937.
